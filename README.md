# SDWAN NewHope

Software-defined networking in a wide area network (SD-WAN) quickly becomes very popular in Enterprises. Vendors promises "on-the-fly agility, simplicity, security and automation" and many other benefits. 
What do you know about SD-WAN? What the "security" means from hand-on perspective? Are present SD-WAN solutions really secure? 
The goal of this project is to give answers on the questions by analysing different real SD-WAN solutions from the adversaries' point of view.
